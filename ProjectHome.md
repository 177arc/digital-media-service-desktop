## Overview ##
The Digital Media Service Desktop (DMS Desktop) is a desktop application that guides the user through the process of producing and then publishing digital audio recordings on the web (as **[MP3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) files**, as **[podcast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast)** and **[RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)**) and on **CD**.

It offers the following main advantages:
  * **easy to learn** for anyone
  * **easy to install and integrate** with exiting infrastructure
  * **customisable** to meet specific needs
  * **free** of charge
Why not take a few minutes to have a look at the **[DMS Desktop demonstration](http://www.christchurchchislehurst.org/dms/demonstration.html)**?
The Leigh Road Baptist Church site shows the published result:

In particular it provides the following features:
    * **Audio meta data entry:** It allows the user to enter data relating to the recordings which is then used for tagging the recordings and managing them. It makes sure that the user does not have to enter the same data again and again, reduces the potential for mistakes and increase consistency.
    * **Recording:** It enables the user to record to the [WAV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) files format. The recording process can be paused.
    * **Conversion to [MP3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3):** The user can convert the [WAV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) files to [MP3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) files. The [MP3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) files can be tagged with the data the user entered.
    * **Web publishing:** It contains the functionality to upload the recoding files to a web server. It also generates a web page containing links to the recordings based on templates and uploads the web page to a web server. With one click, new recordings can be published on the web.
    * **[Podcast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast)/[RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) publishing:** As part of the publishing process it can produce a [podcast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast)/[RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) file and upload to a web server widening the way consumers can access the recordings.
    * **CD buring:** It enables the user to burn an audio CD with the recordings. (requires [Nero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Burning_ROM) 6.0 or later)
    * **Remote support:** It provides the option for the user to send comprehensive support information to an email address simplify  in problem diagnostics and resolution. It is also possible to update the application data remotely.
    * **Application editor:** It includes an editor that allows the user to make certain customisations such as add/editing and deleting new tasks.
### System requirements ###
To run the DMS Desktop, you need at least:
    * Java Runtime Environment 6.0 or higher (is included in one of the distributions)
    * Windows XP or Windows Vista operating system (It may also run on other Java-supported operating systems without the CD burning capabilities although this has not been tested.)
    * 512 MB RAM
    * 200 MB hard disk space
    * Screen resolution of 1024x768 or more
## Getting started ##
Getting started is easy:
    * Just download one of the DMS Desktop distributions (see below). Click [here](http://www.christchurchchislehurst.org/dms/downloads/Digital%20Media%20Service%20Desktop%201.3.2%20(with%20JRE%206).zip) if you are not sure which one you need.
    * Unzip all files to your root directory (e.g. `C:\`).
    * Run `Desktop.bat` (e.g. `C:\Onceforall\DMS Desktop\Desktop.bat`). If you get a warning from your security software, allow Java to access the internet/network.
You should now see something similar to the screenshot above.
**Please note that you will need to purchase a copy of [Nero](http://www.nero.com/eng/nero8-introduction.html) if you want to use the CD burning capabilities.**
