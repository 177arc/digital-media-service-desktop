#summary Describes all necessary steps for testing and producing a software release of the DMS Desktop and the DMS Editor

The release procedure consists of three parts:
  # _prepare_: update documentation and deploy to the testing environment
  # _test_: test the software
  # _release_: build and label release

The result of the release procedure is a up-to-date and tested zip file that contains all the necessary files for running the DMS Desktop and DMS Desktop Editor.

==Prepare==
To prepare the release, please follow these steps:
  # _Update documentation_: Update all the documentation in the `C:\Projects\Digital Media Service\Desktop\Documents` folder to reflect the changes that you have made.
  # Run the `deploy-test`target of the `org.onceforall.dms.desktop.ui\build.xml` ant file.
  # _Deploy DMS Desktop Editor manually_: Although the `deploy-test` target should also deploy the DMS Desktop Editor, this step is not fully automated. To deploy the DMS Editor to the test environment manually:
    # Delete all files in the `C:\Projects\Digital Media Service\Desktop\Development\org.onceforall.dms.desktop.editor\test` directory. 
    # In DMS Development Environment goto `Package Explorer->org.onceforall.dms.desktop.editor->DMS Desktop Editor.product`.
    # On the `Overview` tab of `DMS Desktop Editor.product`, select `Eclipse Product export wizard`.
    # In the `Export` dialog, don't change the default settings, just click `Finish`. 
    # In the `C:\Projects\Digital Media Service\Desktop\Development\org.onceforall.dms.desktop.editor\test` directory, you should see now `editor.exe` together with some other folders.
    # Test that editor starts by running the `editor.exe`.

To produce a software release, follow these steps:
  # Run the `deploy` target of  `org.onceforall.dms.desktop.ui\build.xml`.
