#summary Describes all necessary steps for testing and producing a software release of the DMS Desktop and the DMS Editor

The release procedure consists of three parts:
  # _Prepare_: Update documentation and deploy to the testing environment
  # _Test_: Test the software
  # _Release_: Label and package the release

The result of the release procedure is a up-to-date and tested zip file that contains all the necessary files for running the DMS Desktop and DMS Desktop Editor.

==Prepare==
To prepare the release, please follow these steps:
  # _Update documentation_: Update all the documentation in the `C:\Projects\Digital Media Service\Desktop\Documents` folder to reflect the changes that you have made.
  # _Deploy to test environment_: Run the `clean-test` and `deploy-test` targets of the `org.onceforall.dms.desktop.ui\build.xml` ant file. This creates a test environment in the  `org.onceforall.dms.desktop.ui\test` directory.
  # _Deploy DMS Desktop Editor manually_: Although the `deploy-test` target should also deploy the DMS Desktop Editor, this step is not fully automated. To deploy the DMS Editor to the test environment manually:
    # Delete all files in the `C:\Projects\Digital Media Service\Desktop\Development\org.onceforall.dms.desktop.editor\test` directory. 
    # In DMS Development Environment goto `Package Explorer->org.onceforall.dms.desktop.editor->DMS Desktop Editor.product`.
    # On the `Overview` tab of `DMS Desktop Editor.product`, select `Eclipse Product export wizard`.
    # In the `Export` dialog, don't change the default settings, just click `Finish`. 
    # In the `C:\Projects\Digital Media Service\Desktop\Development\org.onceforall.dms.desktop.editor\test` directory, you should see now `editor.exe` together with some other folders.
    # Test that editor starts by running the `editor.exe`.

==Test==
Once the DMS Desktop and DMS Desktop Editor have been deployed to the test environment in the `org.onceforall.dms.desktop.ui\test` directory two types of tests have be executed:
  # _Automatic tests_: TBC.
  # _Manual tests_: TBC.

==Release==
To package the DMS Desktop and the DMS Desktop Editor into a software release, follow these steps:
  # Run the `deploy` target of `org.onceforall.dms.desktop.ui\build.xml`. This should create two zip files in the `C:\Projects\Digital Media Service\Desktop\Development\Release` directory.
